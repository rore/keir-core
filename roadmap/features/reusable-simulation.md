## Summary

Turn the useful fixed sample harnesses into a small domain-independent tooling seam using the same runtime and artifact.

## In Scope

- Define a versioned, bounded data-only scenario contract, deterministic adapters, structured mismatches and consumer-result output.
- Reuse the existing interpreter and diagnostic model; protected context/fixture selection remains host-owned, never scenario authority.
- Provide a host-conformance kit for native context and consumer checks; actual database/service guarantee tests remain host-owned.

## Out of Scope

A production adapter certification service or a mandatory replacement for the already working minimal harnesses.

## Done When

- [ ] Design/spec: publish scenario/report schemas and the adapter/consumer seam with explicit authority and redaction boundaries.
- [ ] Implementation: run both task and non-task examples through reusable tooling in Java and Node without another execution engine.
- [ ] Verification: same-artifact parity, missing/extra/out-of-order stubs, invalid authority fields, typed consumer failures and redacted reports are covered.

## Notes

**Dependencies:** [generic-hook-capability-contract](../features/generic-hook-capability-contract.md).

**First increment:** The user approved a bounded read/2 task-advice simulation slice. Contract discovery precedes implementation: data-only scenarios, host-owned fixture authority, strict response matching, independent expectations and bounded redacted reports through the same Java and Node artifact/runtime. The [Work Record](../../.agent-workflow/tasks/read2-reusable-simulation.md) owns its plan and evidence. Studio UX is independent; effect simulation and the broader host-conformance kit remain outside this increment.

**Design input:** [Scenarios and test layers, sections 2-7](../../docs/internal/design-baseline/public/simulation-and-authoring-v0.md); [Host conformance, section 12](../../docs/internal/design-baseline/public/host-integration-and-hook-contracts-v0.5.md).

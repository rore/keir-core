# Agents using Keir

Keir has two product-facing agent personas. Both are host integrations over Keir's contracts; core remains usable without an agent.

| Persona | User and task | Guide |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Host integration assistant | Helps the host developer define the domain, DCM, hooks, capabilities, adapters and contracts | [Host integration](host-integration-assistant.md) |
| Customer extension assistant | Helps a customer describe a customization, author an extension/scenarios and review simulation before requesting activation | [Extension authoring](extension-assistant.md) |

**Status:** initial guidance for proposed workflows, not installed tools or a complete SDK. Host integrations and optional skill packaging are future work.

Both guides distinguish the implemented `/1` profiles from the [proposed generic-hook correction](../specs/generic-hook-capability-contract.md). Generic hooks must not require a sample program's call list; optional restrictive policy, aggregate budgets and current authorization are separate concerns. Do not advertise the corrected default as executable before compiler and both runtimes qualify it.

Each guide explains the system, task, inputs, allowed actions and approvals. Both reference one [specification set](../specs/README.md); prompts must not contain a competing language/DCM specification. As APIs are implemented, provide structured schemas, scoped discovery, diagnostics and valid/invalid examples from the same contracts.

These personas are separate from [our engineering team roles](../../roles/README.md). Host-specific tools, credentials and policy belong to the host. Discovery, compilation, simulation and activation requests are authoring operations; they are not automatically runtime capabilities callable by a customer extension.
